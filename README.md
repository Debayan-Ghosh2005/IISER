## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how different machine learning fine-tuning strategies impact performance on a classification problem. It includes:

- ✅ **Baseline Training**
- 🔄 **Full Fine-Tuning**
- 🎯 **Few-Shot & One-Shot Fine-Tuning**
- 📊 **Threshold Tuning for F1 Optimization**
- 🚀 **Beginning of Reinforcement Learning Integration**

The goal is to simulate real-world scenarios where labeled data is limited and explore reinforcement learning techniques in upcoming stages.

## 🔁 Upcoming: Reinforcement Learning (RL)

We're beginning the next phase with **Reinforcement Learning**, aimed to include:

- 🧠 Basic agent-environment interaction
- 🕹️ Simple OpenAI Gym environments (e.g., CartPole, FrozenLake)
- 📊 Comparing supervised vs. RL-based decision making
- 🔄 Future script additions: `rl_agent.py`, `env_setup.py`

Future folder:
```

└───Reinforcement\_Learning
├── rl\_agent.py           # First RL model (Q-Learning/Policy Gradient)
├── env\_setup.py          # Environment loading and preprocessing
